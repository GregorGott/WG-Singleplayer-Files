## How to write Singleplayer files?
Word Guesser only accept .txt files. Create a .txt file on your machine and
write every word in a new line. You can write more than one word in one line,
but Word Guesser detect it as one word with whitespace.

    Word1
    Word2
    Word3
    Word4 with some whitespaces

If you want to write a comment, write '##' at the beginning of the line.
In-line comments are not allowed.

## ‚úÖ Allowed

    ## This is a comment.
    ## Also a comment.
    That is
    not
    a comment

Word Guesser detects three words: "That is", "not" and "a comment"


## ‚ùå Bad way
    Duck ## Is my favourite animal
    Pinguin ## Really nice animal
    Dinosaur ## I want to see one

Word Guesser won‚Äôt detect the comments: "Duck ## Is my favourite animal",
"Pinguin ## Really nice animal" and "Dinosaur ## I want to see one".


*That's it, simple, huh?*

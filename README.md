## How to write Singleplayer files?

You can write more than one word in one line, but Word Guesser detect it as one word with space.

    ## This is a comment.
    ## Also a comment.
    That is
    not
    a comment

Word Guesser detects three words:
* "That is"
* "not"
* "a comment"


*That's it, simple, huh?*
